* What is a static method in Java?

Static methods can only access static fields, they cannot access non-static fields. The 'static' modifier can be on a class or a variable.
* Why does the main method need to be a static method?

Main is a special method, and it is declared static to make it class-related. 
## #3
Program 1: "Wrong"

Program 2: "Correct" 

## #4
The program does not change the season because String str only exists within the function change_season. 

## #5 
"X: 0, Y: 0"

## #6
Private is an access modifier that assists in 'information hiding', what allows certain variables and classes to be hidden and remain untouched from the public.

## #7
It depends on the constructor and specific parameters called.

## #8
Option 2 works because we are directly accessing x and y through the class. Option 4 works as we are declaring new variables and setting them equal to -this.x and -this.y. 

## #9
The output is "(0,0)". This referenced the parent classes' variables and changed them through super after changing them through setXY.

## #10
Then the output would be "(10,10)".

## #11
All implementations are valid ways of returning the sum. 

## #12
Protected is an access modifier that allows functions or variables to be accessible within different subclasses.

## #13
```Java
public FormulaOne(String theMake){
  make = theMake;
}
public String toString() {
  return "Car #: " + super.number + " The Driver: " + super.driver + " The make: " + make;
}
```
## #14
This would not work in either situation because the sponsor is a protected variable and addSponsor is a protected method, limiting its access to only the class it is in.

## #15
![My Diagram (followed along in class)](csci2113-diagram.pdf)

We need employee, manager, unit, and CEO classes. Unit and employee have dependencies on each other, and unit has a dependency on manager. CEO is associated with manager which is associated with employee.
